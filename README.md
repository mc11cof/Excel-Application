# Excel-Application
A application that allows you to transform lists or datasets into excel spreadsheets using the 'openpyxl' library from python.

The "Excel-Python+Cheat+Sheet.py" file has all the necessary information for the making of a excel spreadsheet using the openpyxl library.

The "Excel-Application.py" file is a exemplar that I made to show how to use the tools from the 'openpyxl' library
